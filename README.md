## Game level generation.
Level can be generated in two ways. 
- Randomly generated level with random number of obstacles and random tank and obstacles location.
- Pre-defined level layout in `level.txt` in root folder (for now). In this file, `_` stands for empty tile, `T` is a tree (obstacle), `X` is tank.
